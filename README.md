# LUXtre Wallet

Luxcore aims to deploy Smart Contracts, LuxGate and Parallel Masternodes as part of its technical and business roadmap. A QT based wallet supporting these modules brings its own share of complexities in terms of scalability of the platform, ease of adding additional plug-ins, dApps and functionalities.
LUXtre (a take on the latin word, Lustre, meaning – to brighten) a hierarchical deterministic wallet client was born out of this desire to simplify both the end user experience and enhance the technical capabilities. Based on Daedalus, LUXtre goes one step ahead to enable Hybrid coin support and Masternode features.

It combines Javascript, HTML and CSS as it is built on the Electron platform (https://electronjs.org/). While it opens up the amazing capability of adding multiple home-grown and other plugins, it also ensures secure API connectivity.
LUXtre is platform agnostic and will form the base for our upcoming technical features like LuxGate and ParallelMasternodes, while actively supporting Smart Contract functionality.

## Automated build

### CI/dev build scripts

Platform-specific build scripts facilitate building Luxcore the way it is built
by the IOHK CI:

   - `scripts/build-installer/linux.sh     <LUXCORE-VERSION> <LUXCOIN-BRANCH> [OPTIONS..]`
      - where OS is either `linux` or `osx`
      - facilitates installer upload to S3 via `--upload-s3`
   - `scripts/build-installer/win64.bat <LUXCORE-VERSION> <LUXCOIN-BRANCH>`

The result can be found at:
   - on OS X:    `${BUILD}/installers/dist/Luxcore-installer-*.pkg`
   - on WIndows: `${BUILD}/installers/luxcore-*-installer.exe`

### One-click build-fresh-luxcore scripts

These rely on the scripts from the previous section, but also go to a certain
trouble to ensure that dependencies are installed, and even check out a fresh
version of Luxcore from the specifid branch.

These are intended to be used by developers in a "clean rebuild" scenario, to
facilitate validation.

Dependencies:
   - on OS X:    `git`
   - on Windows: `Node.js`, `7zip`

Location:
   - on OS X:    https://github.com/LUX-Core/luxtre/blob/master/scripts/osx-bundle.sh
   - on Windows: https://github.com/LUX-Core/luxtre/blob/master/scripts/windows-bundle.bat

Invocation:
   ```shell
   {osx,windows}-bundle.{sh,bat} [BRANCH] [GITHUB-USER] [OPTIONS...]
   ```
   ..where `BRANCH` defaults to the current release branch, and `GITHUB-USER`
   defaults to `LUX-Core`.

   The remaining `OPTIONS` are passed as-is to the respective build scripts.

## Stepwise build

### Install Node.js dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development

run with one command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Or run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

*Note: requires a node version >= 4 and an npm version >= 3. This project
defaults to 6.x*

### Development - with Luxcoin Wallet (luxcore-bridge)

Build and run luxcore-bridge [using instructions in the repo](https://github.com/LUX-Core/luxtre)

Symlink the npm package in the subfolder `pos-haskell-prototype/luxcore`:
* `npm link` (inside the luxcore sub folder of the Luxcoin client)
* `npm link luxcore-client-api` (inside this luxcore frontend app)

Run with `npm run dev`

### Development - network options

There are four different network options you can run Luxcore in: `mainnet`, `testnet` and `development` (default).
To set desired network option use `NETWORK` environment variable:

```bash
$ NETWORK=testnet npm run dev
```

### Testing

You can run the test suite in two different modes:

**One-time run:**
For running tests once using the application in prod mode (which is fast)
instead of dev with webpack hot-reload server (which is slow).

Execute this once before running the tests (which creates the `dist/bundle.js`):
```bash
$ npm run build
``` 

After that, execute this to run the tests:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

**Watch & Rerun on file changes:**
For development purposes run the tests continuously in watch mode which will re-run tests when source code changes.

Execute:
```bash
$ npm run hot-server
```

and then this:
```bash
$ npm run test-watch
```

You can find more details regarding tests setup within [Running Luxcore acceptance tests](https://github.com/LUX-Core/luxtre/README.md) README file.

### CSS Modules

This boilerplate out of the box is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

All `.css` file extensions will use css-modules unless it has `.global.css`.

If you need global styles, stylesheets with `.global.css` will not go through the
css-modules loader. e.g. `app.global.css`

### Externals

If you use any 3rd party libraries which can't or won't be built with webpack, you must list them in your `webpack.config.base.js`：

```javascript
externals: [
  // put your node 3rd party libraries which can't be built with webpack here (mysql, mongodb, and so on..)
]
```

For a common example, to install Bootstrap, `npm i --save bootstrap` and link them in the head of app.html

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
<link rel="image/svg+xml" href="../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot" />
...
```

Make sure to list bootstrap in externals in `webpack.config.base.js` or the app won't include them in the package:
```js
externals: ['bootstrap']
```

## Packaging

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

### Options

- --name, -n: Application name (default: ElectronReact)
- --version, -v: Electron version (default: latest version)
- --asar, -a: [asar](https://github.com/atom/asar) support (default: false)
- --icon, -i: Application icon
- --all: pack for all platforms

Use `electron-packager` to pack your app with `--all` options for darwin (osx), linux and win32 (windows) platform. After build, you will find them in `release` folder. Otherwise, you will only find one for your os.
